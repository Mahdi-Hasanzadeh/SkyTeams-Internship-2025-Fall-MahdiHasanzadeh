## Internship Program Week-2

In this week, we focused on problem-solving and testing skills. We solved 25 programming questions, implementing corresponding tests for each. This helped us improve our coding efficiency, logic formulation, and test-writing abilities.

# Testing

We continued practicing Automation Testing using the Vitest library, writing tests for all the problems we solved. This strengthened our understanding of test-driven development and improved our confidence in ensuring code correctness.
